## **I Really Do Suck**

Yes. Yes, I do.

After a year or so of not actually developing anything worthwile besides little scripts for most of the more theoretical courses I took for uni, I've found myself incapable of even STARTING a project I want to do now.

I haven't really given this as much thought and even told myself that I could just start re-learning all the stuff I've lost by working on little hobby projects until the unthinkable happened: I got referred to a job.

## What Made Me Realize I Suck

The job that was offered to me had everything I've ever dreamed of: I was gonna get paid a bit more than most companies would have offered a 3rd year college student, I got to work under someone I respected a lot and would have had no problem being my mentor, the office was only a few kilometers away from uni which didn't even matter much since they told me I could work from home AND could work at any time of the day, and one of my best friends since senior high school was gonna be working in the same office with me.

The interviewer/boss gave me the simplest of tasks: to build an adjustable queue ticketing system similar to the one that my school had for the accounting department.

## Why I Suck

Lack of initiative. Genuinely thought I was better than I was (not knowing anything at all).

## How I'm Going To Deal With Sucking

If realizing how bad you actually are at a thing is half the battle then actually getting better at it is like eight halves.
