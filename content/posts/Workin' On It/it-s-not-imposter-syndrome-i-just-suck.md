## **I Really Do Suck**

Yes. Yes, I do.

After a year or so of not actually developing anything worthwile (the last time I touched this site's code was August 23, 2022) besides little scripts for most of the more theoretical courses I took for uni, I've found myself incapable of even STARTING a project I want to do now.

I haven't really given this as much thought and even told myself that I could just start re-learning all the stuff I've lost by working on little hobby projects until the unthinkable happened: I got referred to a job.

## What Made Me Realize I Suck

The job that was offered to me had everything I've ever dreamed of: I was gonna get paid a bit more than most companies would have offered a 3rd year college student, I got to work under someone I respected a lot and would have had no problem being my mentor, the office was only a few kilometers away from uni which didn't even matter much since they told me I could work from home AND could work at any time of the day, and one of my best friends since senior high school was gonna be working in the same office with me.

The interviewer/boss gave me the simplest of tasks: to build an adjustable queue ticketing system similar to the one that my school had for the accounting department and submit the work with proper documentation within a week. 

Almost immediately after I was given the instructions, I realized that this project wasn't simple at all. I had unlearned everything I knew about web development and my dumb ass even though to give myself a challenge - A CHALLENGE - by developing the entire project with a JavaScript framework that I have never in my life seen anyone work with let alone work with it myself. Heck, I wasn't even that good with JavaScript in the slightest being an avid fan of PHP development my entire college life.

Long story short, I tried all I could trying to learn and develop the system at the same time and ended up crashing and burning and apologizing to the boss for wasting their time. What. A. Joke.

## Why I Suck

I think I suck because I thought I didn't suck. This is apparently a pretty common thing for people who've peaked in high-school. I genuinely thought that I had the ability to learn any language and any framework I wanted within a short period of time when, realistically, I could learn one within three months at minimum.

My friends think I'm being way to hard on myself by thinking I suck in the first place but that's only because I talk such a big game despite not even having a ticket to the game.

With all of this in mind, I'm going to actually try to work on my career this time. I want to be who I've always thought I was: a genuinely good developer who doesn't suck.

## How I'm Going To Deal With Sucking

Now that the oversharing is out of the way, it's time to plan out the pathway to Not-Sucking Town and if realizing how bad you actually are at a thing is half the battle then actually getting better at it has got to be like eight halves.
